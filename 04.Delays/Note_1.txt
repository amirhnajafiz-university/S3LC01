 Electronic signals travel along conductors at about 8cm per nanosecond (the actual speed depends on the conductor material, dimensions, and other external factors). Electronic switches, like the field-effect transistors (FETs) used in logic circuits, typically require up to several hundred picoseconds to turn on and off. When a switch does turn on, it must transfer charge to or from the capacitance at its output node, and again, this takes time. All of these factors contribute to the simple fact that time is required for electric signals to propagate through logic circuits. Restated, time is required to process information in digital circuits. This processing time is divided between the less significant signal transmission time, and the more significant propagation delays associated with switching logic circuits. If not managed properly, propagation delays can result in logic circuits that run too slowly to meet their requirements, or that fail altogether.

A simple logic circuit, its equivalent CMOS circuit, and a timing diagram are shown below in Fig. 1 with a particular intra-gate node (N1) highlighted. The timing diagram illustrates logical behavior of signals as a function of time. Note that if B changes from low to high when C is high as shown, the circuit node N1 changes from high to low after a time τ1 has elapsed. The time τ1 is the “propagation delay” associated with the NAND gate. Referring to the CMOS circuit, the propagation delay τ1 models transistor Q1 turning on and discharging node N1 from Vdd to GND. Although there is no actual capacitor at the output node, all of the signal wires and FET connections associated with the circuit node N1 behave like a single capacitor, and this “parasitic” accumulated capacitance is shown lumped into a single component labeled C1. As is the case with any capacitor, C1 cannot transition from Vdd to GND immediately; the propagation delay τ1 models the time required to discharge this capacitance.
