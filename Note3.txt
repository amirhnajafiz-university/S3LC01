Karnaugh Map:

Method of graphically representing
the truth table that helps visualize
adjacencies.

Everything in a karnaugh map is also in truth table.
Each house is next to other house if their codes have different in only 1 bite.
	Corners can also be next to each other.

- One cell = a minterm (or a maxterm)
- Multiple-cell areas = standard terms


Don't Cares can be treated as 1's or 0's, whichever is more advantageous.
In map just put X in place of them.
We can put 1 or 0 for don't cares in a way that we want and makes our circuit
simpler.

Defenitions :
	Implicant:	single element of the ON-set or any group of elements that
		can be combined together in a K-map (= adjacency plane)
	Prime Implicant (PI): implicant (a circled set of 1-cells) satisfying the combining
		          rule, such that if we try to make it larger (covering twice as
                                            many cells), it covers one or more 0s.
	Distinguished 1-cell: an input combination that is covered by only one PI.
	Essential Prime Implicant (EPI): a PI that covers one or more distinguished 1-cells.

How to get function from table => Minimum cover =
				First: cover EPIs
				Then: minimum number of PIs

5-Variable K-Map
To create them we use two 4 K-maps with different values for the 5th variable.
>> This is like a 3D cube so the next houses can be from different maps.
Same 6-Var K-maps are the same as 5 ones.
