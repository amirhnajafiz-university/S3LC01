ROM :
read only memory

Can be used :
	- to implement any arbitrary combinational circuit as a memory
Consists of :
	- an n-to-2^n decoder that produces ALL minterms a set of programmable OR gates that produce SoP’s
	- Is usually described in terms of :
		- size of its decoder output (number of memory rows)
		- number of OR gates (memory width)

Memories : 
	Volatile :
		Random Access Memory (RAM) :
		− SRAM: "static"
		− DRAM: "dynamic"
	Non-Volatile :
		- ROM
		- PROM
		- EPROM
		- EEPROM
		- FLASH memory: similar to EEPROM with programmer integrated on chip
