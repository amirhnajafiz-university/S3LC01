PAL & PLA :
programming logic array => - Pre-fabricated building block of many AND/OR gates (or NOR, NAND)
		          - General purpose logic building blocks
		          - “Personalized” or “customized” by making/breaking connections among the gates.
		          - This process is called "programming"

In plas we can program a circuit by changing the status of "programable connections".

programming array logic => Same as pla but with a less cost, because of existance of constant circuits in some parts of the pla.
