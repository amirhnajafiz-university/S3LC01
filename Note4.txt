Delays
Circuits in real world have delays. We can avoid them cause of :
				1- Simplfy
				2- Static analysis not dynamic.
In real world we have two kind of delays:
	1- Tphl => delay in changing from high to low ( 1 => 0 ) 
	2- Tplh => delay in changing from low to high ( 0 => 1 )
	And the Tpd which is the total delay in circuit is max(Tphl, Tplh).
	50% of high and 50% of low is our time limit in both Ts.
This delays can happen between any two elements in a circuit.
This changes the diagram and the results of a function.

==> This unwanted delays make some pales called "glitch".
