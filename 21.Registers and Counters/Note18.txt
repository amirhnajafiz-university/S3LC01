Registers and Counters

> An n-bit register = n flip-flops arranged to work together.
> Capable of storing n bits of binary information.

If we want to manage the registration we use a load control input.
this allows us to decide whenever to make a clock so the data will update.

Due to some problems in clocking we can create this circuit with a w/o clock gating.


Shift Register
a serial transfer of information from register A to register B.
moves the data to next register.

Serial addition using shift registers:
The two binary numbers to be added serially are stored in two shift registers.
The sum bit on the S output of the full adder is transferred into the result register A.


Serial addition => uses 1 full adder / very slower than parallel
Parallel addition => uses n full adders / faster

Load control allows us to add new data or keep the data we had.
Shift register with parallel load :
using a shift register that has n bits for loading to happen.
	Shift Load Operation
	0       0       Nothing
	0       1       Load parallel
	1       X      Shift Q0 => Q1, Q1 => Q2

Bidirectional shift register :
same as normal shift register , but with the ability to shift back too.
	S1S0	Action
	00	Nothing
	01	Shift down
	10	Shift up
	11	Parallel load
