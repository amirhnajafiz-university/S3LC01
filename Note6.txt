Multiplexer - MUX:

Multiplexer (Selector) 
- 2^n data inputs
- n control inputs 
- 1 output 
- Described as 2n:1 
Is used to connect only one of 2^n inputs to a single output at a given time.
The control signal pattern forms the binary index of the input connected to the output.
Called “MUX” for brevity.

Basically the mux is just a selector that works by its controllers.

Large muxes have the design to be impliment by smaller muxes.


To chose multi signals we use multimuxes.
The diagram is just like muxes, but the connections are in a way that multi signals are choosed for 
the results.

Adder is what the gate named for this operation.

The multimux is like this:
	----------------	----------------
  input =	| x1 x2 x3 x4 |	| y1 y2 y3 y4 |
	----------------	----------------
		       mux
		----------------
	 output =	| z1 z2 z3 z4 |
		----------------
	So the output is neither x1..x4 or y1..y4

General Logic by MUX:
Any Boolean function of n variables can be implemented using a 2^n-1:1 multiplexer.
- n-1 inputs go to the control lines directly
- One input is used to appropriately determine the output

>> The choice of the singled-out input doesn’t change the functionality but it affects the complexity.
>> MUXes can only implement single-output functions.
