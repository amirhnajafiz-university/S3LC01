The memory cell is the fundamental building block of computer memory.
The memory cell is an electronic circuit that stores one bit of binary information and it must be set to store a logic 1 (high voltage level) and reset to store a logic 0 (low voltage level). 
Its value is maintained/stored until it is changed by the set/reset process. 
The value in the memory cell can be accessed by reading it.

Over the history of computing, different memory cell architectures have been used, including core memory and bubble memory. 
Today, the most common memory cell architecture is MOS memory, which consists of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) memory cells. 
Modern random-access memory (RAM) uses MOS field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) as flip-flops, along with MOS capacitors for certain types of RAM.

The SRAM (static RAM) memory cell is a type of flip-flop circuit, typically implemented using MOSFETs. 
These require very low power to keep the stored value when not being accessed. A second type, DRAM (dynamic RAM), is based around MOS capacitors. 
Charging and discharging a capacitor can store a '1' or a '0' in the cell. However, the charge in this capacitor will slowly leak away, and must be refreshed periodically. 
Because of this refresh process, DRAM uses more power. However, DRAM can achieve greater storage densities.

On the other hand, most non-volatile memory (NVM) is based on floating-gate memory cell architectures. 
Non-volatile memory technologies including EPROM, EEPROM and flash memory use floating-gate memory cells, 
which are based around floating-gate MOSFET transistors.
