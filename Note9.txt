Verilog :
The and , or gates in verilog act with some rules => check pdf 10

In verilog lang , we can create vector insted of signals.
	Ex: output [0:3] D;
	      wire [7:0] SUM;
And we can use indexing to them and slicing them.

Verilog also have the keys bufif1 and notif0,
which are tri-state buffers and inverters.

Also to give an output to multi gates, you can define a 'tri' output which will let you to connect more than one outputs to it.
