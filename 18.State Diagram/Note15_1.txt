State Diagram :
The sequential circuit function can be represented in graphical form as a state diagram with the following components:
	> A circle with the state name in it for each state
	> A directed arc from the Present State to the Next State for each state transition
	> A label on each directed arc with the Input values which causes the state transition, and
	> A label :
		- In each circle with the output value produced (Moore), or
		- On each directed arc with the output value produced (Mealy)

Label form:
In circle (for Moore machines):
	> state/output
	> Moore type output depends only on state
On directed arc (for Mealy machines):
	> input/output
	> Mealy type output depends on state and input

If we want the state table for jk flip-flop : 
	1. Obtain binary values of each FF input equation in terms of present state and input variables.
	2. Use corresponding FF characteristic table to determine the next state.

Note >> in moore circuits there is at least one path from input to output that does not have any flipflops init.

Note >> sometimes circuits can have no nonrelative inputs, thus they are moore machines.
In these circuits we often go through situations in a loop.
