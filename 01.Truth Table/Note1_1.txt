Truth table: a unique representation of a Boolean function.

The truth table is unique for a boolean expression but a truth
table can be convert to many boolean expressions.

Complementation of a function is its not.
	The complement of a function can also be derived by 
	finding thefunction’s dual, and then complementing all of the literals.


Minterms and Maxterms
Minterms = > A product term (with value 1) in which all the 
	variables appear exactly once, either complemented or uncomplemented.
Maxterms = > A sum term (with value 0) in which...

Any Boolean function F( ) can be expressed as a unique sum of
	minterms (and a unique product of maxterms).

Each minterm is only true on its own line and false on the other lines.
Also each maxgerm is only false on its own line and true on the other lines.

And we can create the F function by the sum of minterms and product of maxterms 
and this creation is unique.

The min and max terms are called the canonical forms and the rest forms are standard forms.
In standard forms we don't have all the literals in every sentence.

If we want to change the minterm form to maxterm form we need to first expand the function
into a Sigma and then conver it to  maxterms.

To convert standard form to minterm canonical we product (a+a`) to the sentences that don't have
the literals they need.
And for maxterm canonicals we use (aa`) in their sentences.
==> in above forms we use dirstractive laws to expand the function.


Theorems for XOR
	X NOR 0 = X
	X NOR 1= X '
	X NOR X = 0
	X NOR X ' = 1
	X NOR Y = Y NOR X (commutative law)
	X NOR Y = XY' + X'Y
