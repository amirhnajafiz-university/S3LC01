Product of sum => Change the function into some form that all the literals are 1- single
							2- only sums are acceptable between and product between two multi sentenses
	Ex: (A + B) ( B + C + D ) is product of sum
	      (AB + C) (C + D) is not cause of AB

Sum of product => Change the function into some form that all the literals are 1- single
							 2- only product between them
	Ex: AB + CD + BCDE is sum of product
	      (A + B)C + BC is not couse of (A+B)

A useful theorem for multiplying out: (X + Y)(X '+  Z) = XZ + X'Y
Theorem for factoring: AB + A`C = (A + C)(A` + B)
